# Scheduling Cron Jobs in Kawkab

**Cron Jobs** are a powerful mechanism for scheduling and executing tasks periodically at specific times, and they are a core part of any application that requires regular execution of scheduled operations. In **Kawkab**, you can easily and flexibly set the timing of tasks through **Cron** settings, allowing you to customize the task schedule according to your specific needs.

## Creating a Cron Job in Kawkab

To add a new **Cron Job** in **Kawkab**, you can use the following command to create the scheduled task:

```bash
npm run kawkab cron:make <name> [module]
```

- `<name>`: The name of the Cron Job you want to create.
- `[module]`: The module to which you want to add the Cron Job (optional, and the default is `main`).

### Practical Example:

Suppose you want to create a Cron Job named `DailyTask` in the `tasks` module, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run kawkab cron:make DailyTask tasks
```

## Cron Syntax

The **Cron** syntax consists of five fields, and it determines when tasks will be executed based on the following fields:

1. **Minute**: (0-59) - The minute when the task will be executed.
2. **Hour**: (0-23) - The hour when the task will be executed.
3. **Day of Month**: (1-31) - The day of the month when the task will be executed.
4. **Month**: (1-12) - The month when the task will be executed.
5. **Day of Week**: (0-6) - The day of the week when the task will be executed (0 is Sunday, and 6 is Saturday).

### How to Set Time in Cron

You can specify the task execution timing easily using **Kawkab** through custom functions in the `BaseCronJob` class, which handles task scheduling. Here are some examples of how to set task timing:

#### Task Scheduling Examples:

1. **Run the task every minute**:
   ```text
   * * * * *
   ```

2. **Run the task at the beginning of every hour**:
   ```text
   0 * * * *
   ```

3. **Run the task daily at 3 AM**:
   ```text
   0 3 * * *
   ```

4. **Run the task every Sunday at 5 PM**:
   ```text
   0 17 * * 0
   ```

5. **Run the task on the first day of every month**:
   ```text
   0 0 1 * *
   ```

6. **Run the task on Monday at 6 AM**:
   ```text
   0 6 * * 1
   ```

7. **Run the task on the first day of the month at 12 PM**:
   ```text
   0 12 1 * *
   ```

## Customizing Task Timing in Kawkab

**Kawkab** allows you to customize task timing using built-in functions in the `BaseCronJob` class. The following code illustrates how to customize Cron Job execution timing in Kawkab using various timing functions:

### Setting Time in **BaseCronJob**:

1. **Minute**:  
   The `minute()` function is used to specify the minute when the task will be executed.
   
2. **Hour**:  
   The `hour()` function is used to specify the hour when the task will be executed.
   
3. **Day of Month**:  
   The `dayOfMonth()` function is used to specify the day of the month.
   
4. **Month**:  
   The `month()` function is used to specify the month when the task will be executed.
   
5. **Day of Week**:  
   The `dayOfWeek()` function is used to specify the day of the week.

### Practical Example: Scheduling a Cron Job in Kawkab

Assume you want to run a **Cron Job** every Monday at 8:00 AM. The code would look like this:

```typescript
import { BaseCronJob, CronJobDayOfWeekEnum } from 'kawkab';

export default class extends BaseCronJob {
    isEnabled(): boolean {
        return true;  // Ensure the task is enabled
    }

    minute(): number | string {
        return '0';  // Minute 0
    }

    hour(): number | string {
        return '8';  // 8 AM
    }

    dayOfMonth(): number | string {
        return '*';  // Every day of the month
    }

    month(): number | string {
        return '*';  // Every month
    }

    dayOfWeek(): number | string {
        return CronJobDayOfWeekEnum.Monday;  // Monday
    }

    async handle(): Promise<void> {
        console.log("Cron Job is running...");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

**Cron Jobs** are a vital and effective tool for scheduling tasks in any application that requires periodic operations. With **Kawkab**, you can precisely and flexibly define task execution timings, allowing you to customize your task schedule according to your needs without being tied to a specific operating system. Tasks can be executed on all systems that support **Cron Jobs**, making them ideal for cross-platform applications.
