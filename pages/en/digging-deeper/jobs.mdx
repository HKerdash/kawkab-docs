# Creating Jobs with Kawkab

**Jobs** are an effective way to execute background tasks and schedule long-running operations in your application. In this guide, we will learn how to create and use **Jobs** using the **Kawkab** framework.

## Creating a New Job with Kawkab

To create a new **Job** using **Kawkab**, run the following command in the command line:

```bash
npm run kawkab job:make <name> [module]
```

### **Parameter Details:**

- **`<name>`**: The name of the Job you wish to create (e.g., `SendEmail`).
- **`[module]`**: The name of the module containing the Job (optional, default is `main`).

### Example of running the command:

```bash
npm run kawkab job:make SendEmail
```

After executing the command, a Job named `SendEmail` will be created in the `main` module.

## Job File Structure

When a new Job is created, a file with the following basic structure will be generated:

```typescript
import { BaseJob } from "kawkab";

export class SendEmailJob extends BaseJob {
    // Job name - used to identify the job in the queue system
    name(): string {
        return "SendEmailJob";
    }

    // Number of retry attempts in case of failure
    attempts(): number {
        return 3;
    }

    // Delay between retry attempts (in milliseconds)
    delay(): number {
        return 5000;
    }

    // The main logic for the job
    async handle(data: any = {}) {
        // Execute the job logic here
        console.log("Sending email...", data);
    }
}
```

## Using the Job in the Application

### Importing the Job:

```typescript
import { SendEmailJob } from "../jobs/SendEmail";
```

### Running the Job:

You can run the job in two ways:

#### Method 1: Without Data

```typescript
new SendEmailJob();
```

#### Method 2: With Data

```typescript
new SendEmailJob({
    to: "user@example.com",
    subject: "Hello",
    message: "Message content"
});
```

## Job Features in Kawkab

### 1. Handling Data
- You can access the data passed to the job inside the `handle` function using the `data` parameter.
- The data passed to the job is available every time the job is executed.

### 2. Retry Attempts
- You can specify the number of retry attempts in case of failure using the `attempts()` function.
- The delay between retry attempts can be specified using the `delay()` function.

### 3. Naming Jobs
- Every job must have a unique name, which is defined in the `name()` function.
- This name is used to identify the job in the queue system.

## Best Practices

1. **Job Naming**: Use descriptive names that reflect the job's purpose.
2. **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors inside the `handle` function.
3. **Data**: Make sure to validate the data passed to the job before processing it.
4. **Documentation**: Document your jobs thoroughly, especially if they require specific data.

## Practical Example

Here is an example of a job that sends an email:

```typescript
import { BaseJob } from "kawkab";
import { EmailService } from "../services/EmailService";

export class SendEmailJob extends BaseJob {
    name(): string {
        return "SendEmailJob";
    }

    attempts(): number {
        return 3;
    }

    delay(): number {
        return 5000;
    }

    async handle(data: any = {}) {
        try {
            const emailService = new EmailService();
            await emailService.send({
                to: data.to,
                subject: data.subject,
                message: data.message
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Failed to send email:", error);
            throw error; // Re-throwing the error to trigger retry mechanism
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Using **Jobs** in Kawkab provides a powerful and flexible way to execute background tasks. With automatic retry support and custom delays, you can efficiently handle complex and long-running processes. Enjoy building your applications more effectively with the job system in Kawkab!
