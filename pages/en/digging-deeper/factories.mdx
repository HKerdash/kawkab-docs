# Factories in Kawkab

## Overview
Factories in Kawkab provide a simple and effective way to generate fake data for testing and development purposes. Factories use the Faker library to create realistic data.

## Basic Usage

### Creating a New Factory

To create a new **Factory**, run the following command:

```bash
npm run kawkab factory:make <name> [module]
```

### **Parameter Details:**

- **`<name>`**: The name of the factory you want to create (e.g., `User`).
- **`[module]`**: The module that contains the factory (optional, default is `main`).

### **Practical Example:**

```bash
npm run kawkab factory:make user
```

```typescript
import { BaseFactory, faker } from 'kawkab';
import { User } from "../models/user";

export class UserFactory extends BaseFactory {
    async handle() {
        const data = {
            username: faker.internet.userName(),
            email: faker.internet.email()
        };

        await User.query().insert(data);
    }
}
```

### Using the Factory

```typescript
// Create 10 users
new UserFactory(10);

// Create a single user
new UserFactory();
```

## Key Features

1. **Simplicity**: Generate data with a single line of code.
2. **Flexibility**: The generated data can be customized as needed.
3. **Automation**: Data is automatically inserted into the database.
4. **Scalability**: New factories can be added easily.

## Best Practices

1. **Organizing Factories**:
   - Place all factories in the `factories` folder.
   - Follow the naming convention `[ModelName]Factory`.

2. **Data**:
   - Use Faker to generate realistic data.
   - Avoid hardcoded data unless necessary.
   - Ensure all required fields are covered.

3. **Relationships**:
   - Create related records first.
   - Use other factories to create related data.

4. **Testing**:
   - Use factories in your test files.
   - Create diverse test data.
   - Clean up the generated data after tests.

## Important Notes

1. Factories are designed for use in development and testing environments only.
2. Do not use factories in a production environment.
3. Make sure to use a compatible version of Faker.
4. Clean up the generated data periodically.

## Conclusion

Factories in Kawkab provide a simple and effective way to generate test data. You can quickly generate realistic data for your application, making development and testing faster and easier.
