# Translation Settings in Kawkab

Translation is a key feature in Kawkab that allows you to manage and use translations for multiple languages within your application. This feature is designed to simplify multi-language support and ensure a personalized user experience for various languages and cultures.

---

## How to Create Translation Files

To create translation files within your application using Kawkab, you can use the following command to generate a new translation file for the language you need:

```bash
npm run kawkab trans:make <language> [type] [module]
```

### Parameter Details:

- **`<language>`**: The language code for which you want to create the translation (e.g., `ar` for Arabic).
- **`[type]`**: The type of file you want to use (optional: `ts` or `json`, and if not specified, `ts` will be used).
- **`[module]`**: The module name that contains the translation (optional, the default is `main`).

### Example for Creating a Translation File:

Suppose you want to create a translation file for Arabic in the `main` module. You can run the following command:

```bash
npm run kawkab trans:make ar
```

### Result of Execution:

- A file named `ar.json` will be created in the designated translations folder within the module, and its basic structure will be as follows:

```json
{
  "hello_world": "Hello World!"
}
```

## Using Translations in Your Application

After creating translation files, you can easily import and use them in your application. For example:

```ts
import { __, t, trans } from "kawkab";
```

### Using Translations:

#### Using `trans.get`:
You can retrieve a translation using the key for the text you want to translate.

```ts
trans.get("hello_world", {}, "default value");
```

#### Using `__`:
This function provides a shorthand way to retrieve translated texts.

```ts
__("hello_world", {}, "default value");
```

#### Using `t`:
Works the same way as `__`.

```ts
t("hello_world", {}, "default value");
```

---

## Customizing the Language Used

### Setting the Language:

You can change the default language for your application by updating the settings in the `app/configuration.ts` file:

```ts
export const app = {
  locale: {
    default: env.string("LOCALE_CODE", "en"), // default language
    detect: true, // Automatically detect language
  },
};
```

#### - **`default`**:
Used to set the default language for the application. In the example above, the default language is English.

#### - **`detect`**:
Used to automatically detect the language based on the `Accept-Language` header from the request.

---

## Automatically Detecting the User's Language

When the `detect: true` option is enabled in the app settings, Kawkab will automatically detect the user's language based on the `Accept-Language` header. For example:

- If the header contains: `Accept-Language: ar,en;q=0.9`
- The application will use Arabic (`ar`) if supported.

### Changing the Language During Runtime:

You can change the active language during runtime using:

```ts
trans.setLocale("ar"); // to set Arabic as the active language
```

---

## Additional Translation Features

### Placeholders and Variables:

You can use variables inside translation strings to dynamically customize translations. For example:

In the `trans/en.ts` translation file:

```ts
export default {
  hello: "Hello :name!",
};
```

Using the translation with a variable replacement:

```ts
__("hello", { name: "Hassan" });
```

The result will be:

```
Hello Hassan!
```

### Using a Fallback Value:

If no translation is found for a key, you can specify a fallback value that will be shown instead of the translation:

```ts
__("hello", { name: "Hassan" }, "Hello there!");
```

If the key `hello` is not found, the result will be:

```
Hello there!
```

### Specifying Language When Retrieving Translations:

You can specify the language when retrieving a translation:

```ts
__("hello", { name: "Hassan" }, "Hello there!", "ar");
```

---

## Managing Translations

### Retrieving All Translations:

You can retrieve all translations for all languages:

```ts
trans.all();
```

### Retrieving Translations for a Specific Language:

To retrieve translations for a specific language, such as Arabic:

```ts
trans.all("ar");
```

## Ideas for Improving Translations

1. **Clear Key Naming**:
   - Choose descriptive keys that reflect the content, ensuring ease of understanding and management.

2. **Organizing Files**:
   - Keep translations in separate folders for each module and language.

3. **Using Default Values**:
   - Always provide default values to ensure the application works even if translations are missing.

## Conclusion

Kawkab provides a powerful and flexible system for managing translations and supporting multiple languages. With these settings and functions, you can enhance the user experience and offer applications that support a wide variety of cultures and languages easily and effectively.
