# The Logger in Kawkab Kawkab

## Introduction
Logging is an essential part of any application, as it helps track the system's state and behavior. The **Kawkab Kawkab** framework provides a built-in logging system that allows you to log messages at multiple levels such as: `info`, `warn`, `error`, `verbose`, `debug`, and `silly`.

## Using the Logging System

### Importing
To start using the logging system in **Kawkab Kawkab**, you need to import `log` from the **kawkab** library:

```ts
import { log } from "kawkab";
```

## Logging Messages

### Logging a General Message
To log a message at a specific level, use the `message` function and specify the desired log level.

#### Example:
```ts
log.message('info', 'This is an informational message.');
```

---

### Logging an Error Message
To log an error message, use the `error` method:

#### Example:
```ts
log.error('An error occurred in the system.');
```

---

### Logging a Warning Message
To log a warning message, use the `warn` method:

#### Example:
```ts
log.warn('This is a warning message.');
```

---

### Logging an Informational Message
To log an informational message, use the `info` method:

#### Example:
```ts
log.info('This is an informational message.');
```

---

### Logging a Detailed Message
To log a message with more details than an informational level, use the `verbose` method:

#### Example:
```ts
log.verbose('This message contains additional details.');
```

---

### Logging a Debug Message
To log a debug message during development, use the `debug` method:

#### Example:
```ts
log.debug('This is a debugging message.');
```

---

### Logging a Very Detailed Message
To log a message with the highest level of detail, use the `silly` method:

#### Example:
```ts
log.silly('This is a highly detailed message.');
```

---

## Storing Logs

### Log File
All logged messages are stored in a file named `app.log`.  
This file contains all the logged events and can be used for reviewing logs and analyzing system performance.

#### Example of Log File Contents:
```
[2024-11-28T14:32:00.000Z] [INFO] - The application started successfully.
[2024-11-28T14:33:00.000Z] [ERROR] - An error occurred in the database.
```
