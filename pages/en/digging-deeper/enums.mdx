# Creating Enums with Kawkab

**Enums** are a great way to organize predefined constant values in your application in a structured and scalable way. In this guide, we will learn how to create and use **Enums** with the **Kawkab** framework.

## Creating a New Enum with Kawkab

To create a new **Enum** using **Kawkab**, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run kawkab enum:make <name> [module]
```

### **Parameter Details:**

- **`<name>`**: The name of the Enum you want to create (for example, `UserType`).
- **`[module]`**: The name of the module that contains the Enum (optional, the default is `main`).

### Example of Running the Command:

```bash
npm run kawkab enum:make UserType
```

After running the command, an Enum named `UserType` will be created in the `main` module.

### What Happens After Running the Command?

- A file named `UserType` will be successfully created as an Enum.
- You can now use the Enum in your application by importing and utilizing it, as shown in the following example.

## Using the Enum in Your Application

Once the Enum is created, you can import and use it anywhere in your application.

### Importing the Enum:

To import the Enum you created, use the following code in your file:

```javascript
import { UserType, UserTypeEnum } from "../enums/UserType";
```

### Enum File Content:

The content of the `UserType` Enum file will look like this:

```javascript
import { BaseEnum as Enum } from "kawkab";

export enum UserTypeEnum {
    Administrator = 0,       // Administrator
    Moderator = 1,          // Moderator
    Subscriber = 2,         // Subscriber
    SuperAdministrator = 3, // Super Administrator
    // You can add more values here
}

Enum.set(UserTypeEnum);

export class UserType extends Enum<typeof UserTypeEnum> {}
```

### Using the Enum in the Application:

You can use the Enum in multiple ways, as shown in the following examples:

#### Method 1: Accessing Values Using the Enum

```javascript
console.log(UserTypeEnum.Administrator);  // Will print 0
console.log(UserTypeEnum.Moderator);     // Will print 1
```

#### Method 2: Using the `get` Method to Access Values

```javascript
console.log(UserType.get('Administrator'));  // Will print 0
console.log(UserType.get('Subscriber'));    // Will print 2
```

## Additional Notes

- **Using Enum with Other Classes:** You can use the Enum anywhere in the application where you need to represent constant values. These could represent user types, the state of something, etc.
- **Flexibility:** New values can be easily added to the Enum at any time.
- **Renaming:** If you need to rename any values in the Enum, you can modify them directly within the file.

## Conclusion

Using **Enums** in Kawkab helps organize constant values in your application in a clearer and more powerful way. With **Kawkab**, you can create and use Enums in a flexible and simplified manner within your project. Enjoy building more efficient and organized applications!
