# Queue System

The queue system in the Kawkab framework provides an efficient way to handle background tasks. Two types of queue systems can be used:

## 1. Memory Queue
This is the default system when `QUEUE_ENABLE_REDIS=false`. Tasks are stored directly in the application's memory.

### Features:
- Easy to set up - no external services required
- Suitable for local development and small applications
- Tasks are lost when the application is restarted

## 2. Redis Queue
Activated when `QUEUE_ENABLE_REDIS=true`. Redis is used as the task storage system.

### Configuration in `.env` file:
```env
QUEUE_ENABLE_REDIS=true
QUEUE_REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
QUEUE_REDIS_PORT=6379
```

### Features:
- High reliability - tasks are preserved even after restarting the application
- Scalable - can handle a large number of tasks
- Suitable for production and large applications

## Important Notes
- Ensure that the Redis server is running if using the Redis queue
- Queue settings can be modified in the `configuration.ts` file
- Tasks are processed automatically in the background
