# Command System in Kawkab

The **command** system in the **Kawkab** framework provides a powerful and flexible command-line interface to manage and execute various tasks in your application. You can use the built-in commands or create custom ones.

## Viewing Available Commands

To get a list of all available commands, run:

```bash
npm run kawkab
```

This command will display a list of all available commands with a brief description of each one.

## Creating a New Command

### Basic Syntax

```bash
npm run kawkab command:make <name> [module]
```

### Parameter Details:

- **`<name>`**: The name of the command you wish to create.
- **`[module]`**: The name of the module that will contain the command (optional, the default is `main`).

### Example:

```bash
npm run kawkab command:make hello
```

This command will create a new command file at the appropriate location with the following basic structure:

```typescript
import { Command } from "kawkab";

export default function(program: Command): void {
  program
    // Command syntax: '<variable_name>' is required, '[variable_name]' is optional
    .command("hello <name> [module]")
    // Description of the command that will appear in the CLI help
    .description("Your custom command description")
    // Action to be executed when the command is run
    .action(async (name: string, module: string = "main") => {
      // Write your command logic here
      console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
    });
}
```

## Command Structure

### Core Components

1. **`command()`**: Defines the name and syntax of the command
   - Required variables are written between `<>`
   - Optional variables are written between `[]`

2. **`description()`**: A brief description of the command that appears in the help list

3. **`action()`**: The function containing the logic for executing the command
   - It receives the variables defined in the command syntax
   - It can be asynchronous (`async`)

### Adding Options

You can add options to your command using `option()`:

```typescript
program
  .command("hello <name>")
  .option("-c, --capitalize", "Convert the name to uppercase")
  .action(async (name: string, options) => {
    const output = options.capitalize ? name.toUpperCase() : name;
    console.log(`Hello ${output}`);
  });
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Names**: Use descriptive and clear names for your commands.
2. **Good Documentation**: Write a clear and detailed description for each command and its options.
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate inputs before executing the command.
4. **Clear Messages**: Display clear messages to the user about the result of the command execution.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for potential issues.

## Conclusion

The command system in Kawkab provides an easy and flexible way to add new functionality to your application through the command-line interface. With support for required and optional variables and custom options, you can create powerful and useful commands for your application.
