# Data Files in Kawkab

Data files in **Kawkab** are used to organize and store static or dependent data that is utilized in your application. This data could be lists, settings, or any other fixed information you wish to use in your project in an organized manner.

## Creating Data Files with Kawkab

In this guide, we will show you how to create new data files using the **Kawkab** framework and integrate them into your application.

## Step 1: Creating a New Data File

To create a new data file using **Kawkab**, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run kawkab data:make <name> [module]
```

### **Parameter Details:**

- **`<name>`**: The name of the data file you want to create (e.g., `cats`).
- **`[module]`**: The name of the module that contains the data (optional, default is `main`).

### Example of Command Execution:

```bash
npm run kawkab data:make cats
```

This command will create a data file named `cats` inside the `main` module.

### What Happens After Running the Command?

- A data file named `'cats'` will be created in the specified module.
- This file will contain data that can be used in your application. For example, this guide will create a file containing a list of popular cat breeds.

## Step 2: Using the Data in Your Application

Once the data file is created, you can import and use it within your project files.

### Importing the Data:

To import the data that has been created, use the following code in your file:

```javascript
import catsData from '../data/cats';
```

### Contents of the Data File:

The `cats` data file will contain the following data (cat breeds):

```javascript
export default {
  data: [
    "Persian",        // Persian Cats
    "Maine Coon",     // Maine Coon Cats
    "Bengal",         // Bengal Cats
    "Siamese",        // Siamese Cats
    "Ragdoll",        // Ragdoll Cats
    "British Shorthair", // British Shorthair Cats
    "Sphynx",         // Sphynx Cats
    "Abyssinian",     // Abyssinian Cats
    "Scottish Fold",  // Scottish Fold Cats
    "Birman"          // Birman Cats
  ]
}
```

### Using the Data in Your Application:

Now, you can access and use the data easily anywhere in your application:

```javascript
const data = catsData.data;
console.log(data);  // Will print the list of cat breeds
```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the path you use to import the data is correct according to your projectâ€™s folder structure.
- You can use the same approach to create other data files by changing the name of the created file (e.g., `dogs` instead of `cats`).
  
- If you are using multiple modules, you can specify the module that contains the data using the `[module]` parameter:

```bash
npm run kawkab data:make cats customModuleName
```

## Conclusion

Creating data files with Kawkab helps organize and streamline the management of static data in your application. With Kawkab, you can easily create these files and integrate them into your application quickly. Enjoy using **Kawkab** to build your applications more efficiently and flexibly!
