# Settings in Kawkab Kawkab

**Settings** provide an organized way to store values and keys used across the project to customize behaviors or enable/disable specific features. Kawkab Kawkab offers a powerful tool for easily and quickly creating settings files.

## Creating a Settings File

To create a new settings file in Kawkab Kawkab, you can use the following command:

```bash
setting:make <name> [module]
```

### Parts:
- **`<name>`**: The name of the settings file (e.g., `auth`).
- **`[module]`**: The name of the module where the settings will be created. If no module is specified, the file is created in the default `main` module.

---

## Practical Example

Suppose you want to create a settings file named `auth`, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run kawkab setting:make auth
```

### Result:
The following message will appear after execution:

```
üÜó Setting file 'auth' created successfully in module 'main'.

1Ô∏è‚É£  Your setting file is ready! You can now import it like this:
üëâ import { setting } from '../settings/auth'

2Ô∏è‚É£  Use the setting like so:
üëâ const enable:boolean = setting.enable
```

### What happened?
1. A new settings file named `auth` was created inside the default `main` module folder.
2. The file contains ready-to-use settings.
3. You can now import the settings and use them in your project.

---

## Using the Settings

After creating the settings file, you can easily import and use it anywhere in your project.

### Example:
#### Settings file: `auth.ts`
```ts
export const setting = {
    enable: true, // Enable or disable authentication
    loginAttempts: 5, // Number of allowed login attempts
    timeout: 300, // Session timeout duration in seconds
};
```

#### Using the Settings:
```ts
import { setting } from '../settings/auth';

// Read a specific setting
const isAuthEnabled = setting.enable;
console.log(`Authentication Enabled: ${isAuthEnabled}`);

// Use another setting
if (setting.enable) {
    console.log(`Maximum Login Attempts: ${setting.loginAttempts}`);
    console.log(`Session Timeout: ${setting.timeout} seconds`);
}
```

## Customizing the Module

If you want to create a settings file within a specific module instead of the default `main` module, you can specify the module name during execution.

### Example:
```bash
npm run kawkab setting:make database app
```

### Result:
- A settings file named `database` will be created within the `app` module.
- The resulting message:
```
üÜó Setting file 'database' created successfully in module 'app'.

1Ô∏è‚É£  Your setting file is ready! You can now import it like this:
üëâ import { setting } from '../app/settings/database'

2Ô∏è‚É£  Use the setting like so:
üëâ const maxConnections:number = setting.maxConnections
```

## Benefits of Using Settings

1. **Organizing core values**: Separating settings from core code to make them easier to manage.
2. **Customizability**: Easily modify settings to change app behavior without altering code.
3. **Reusability**: Unified settings can be used across different parts of the project.
4. **Ease of maintenance**: Fewer changes needed when updating settings compared to modifying the core code.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Use descriptive names for settings**: Ensure that setting names reflect their purpose.
- **Organize settings by module**: If working on a large project, it‚Äôs better to split settings into modules for easier management.
- **Easily update settings**: Use settings files to avoid repeating values or modifying the core code when settings change.

With this approach, you can easily and efficiently manage your project's settings in **Kawkab Kawkab** using the **Settings** tool.
