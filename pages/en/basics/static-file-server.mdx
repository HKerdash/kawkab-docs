## **Static File Server Configuration**

The **Kawkab Framework** provides a flexible mechanism for configuring the server to serve both public and private files. These settings are configured through the `configuration.ts` file, which includes options for specifying custom paths for public files and how to securely access private files.

---

## **Server Configuration in `configuration.ts`**

### **Serving Public Files**

In **Kawkab Framework**, public file serving can be enabled through `serveStatic` settings that allow access to static files such as images or other files that can be accessed by users. The path where these files will be served is specified, with `/public` being the default path.

#### **Public File Serving Configuration**

```ts
import { env } from 'kawkab'
import { Provider } from './provider'

export const app = {
    app: {
        serveStatic: {
            enable: true,            // Enable public file serving
            path: '/public',         // Path where public files will be accessible
        },
    },
}
```

- **`serveStatic.enable`**: Determines whether public file serving will be enabled.
- **`serveStatic.path`**: Specifies the path where public files will be served (e.g., `/public`).

#### **User Access to Public Files**

Once these settings are enabled, users can access public files stored in the `storage/public` folder via the following URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/public/pic.jpg
```

### **Serving Private Files**

Private files differ from public files in that they cannot be accessed directly through public URLs. These files are stored in the `storage/private` folder and cannot be accessed by users through direct browser links. To access these files, the `response.privateFile` function is used securely.

---

## **Accessing Private Files Using `response.privateFile`**

To retrieve private files from the `storage/private` folder, use the `response.privateFile` function which ensures secure file delivery:

#### **Accessing Private Files**

```ts
import { response } from "kawkab";

async get() {
    return response.privateFile("file.mp4");  // Access private file
}
```

- **`response.privateFile("file.mp4")`**: This function provides secure access to `file.mp4` from the private **storage/private** directory.

---

## **How to Access Files in Kawkab Framework**

### **Public Files**

Public files can be easily accessed through the path specified in the `serveStatic.path` settings. These files must be located in the `storage/public` folder and can be accessed using direct browser URLs.

**Example:**
```
http://localhost:3000/public/pic.jpg
```

### **Private Files**

Private files are stored in the `storage/private` folder and cannot be accessed through direct links. To access them securely, you must use the `response.privateFile()` function within a Controller or elsewhere in the application.

---

## **Configuration Summary**

```ts
import { env } from 'kawkab'
import { Provider } from './provider'

export const app = {
    app: {
        serveStatic: {
            enable: true,        // Enable public file serving
            path: '/public',     // Path for accessing public files
        },
    },
}
```

- **`enable`**: Determines whether public file serving will be enabled.
- **`path`**: Specifies the path where public files will be served.

**Accessing Public Files:**
```
http://localhost:3000/public/pic.jpg
```

**Accessing Private Files:**
```ts
return response.privateFile("file.mp4");
```

---

## **Conclusion**

Configuring public and private file serving in **Kawkab Framework** is a simple and flexible process. Through `configuration.ts`, you can control how public files are served via a specified path while the `response.privateFile` function ensures secure access to private files.
