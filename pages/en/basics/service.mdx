# Managing Services in Kawkab Framework

Services are components in the **Kawkab Framework** used to organize your application's core logic in a reusable way. Services allow you to group common functions and easily reuse them within Controllers or other components.

---

## Service Creation Command

To create a new service, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run kawkab service:make <n> [module]
```

### **Parameters:**
- `<n>`: The name of the service to create (e.g., `login`).
- `[module]` _(optional)_: The name of the module the service belongs to. If no module is specified, it will be placed in the default `main` module.

### **Example:**
```bash
npm run kawkab service:make login
```

---

## Basic Service File Structure

When creating a new service, a file will be created containing the following structure:

```typescript
import { BaseService, Inject, inherit } from "kawkab";

export class LoginService extends inherit(BaseService, Inject) {
    login() {
        console.log("Login Service!");
    }
}
```

### **Code Explanation:**
1. **BaseService**: A base class that provides default functionality that services can utilize.
2. **Inject**: Used for managing dependencies (Dependency Injection).
3. **inherit**: Used to merge functionality from base classes.
4. **LoginService**: An example service containing a simple `login` method that prints a message to the console.

---

## Using Service Inside a Controller

After creating the service, it can be imported and used in Controllers. Here's an example of how to do this:

```typescript
import { BaseController, inherit } from "kawkab";
import { LoginService } from "../services/login";

export default class extends inherit(BaseController) {
  constructor(private loginService = LoginService.inject()) {
    super();
  }

  async post() {
    this.loginService.login();

    return {
      status: true,
      message: "Login Successful",
    }
  }
}
```

### **Code Explanation:**
1. **`LoginService.inject()`**: The service is automatically injected for use within the controller.
3. **`post`**: Uses the `login` method from the service and executes the login logic.

---

## Benefits of Using Services

1. **Code Reusability**: You can use services across multiple modules without duplicating logic.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Services separate core business logic from controllers.
3. **Maintenance Flexibility**: Services can be updated independently without affecting the rest of the application.
4. **Dependency Management**: Kawkab Framework supports easy dependency management using `Inject`.

## Conclusion

Using **Kawkab Framework**, managing services and organizing code becomes easier and more efficient. Services provide a powerful way to manage business logic, making your application more organized and maintainable.
