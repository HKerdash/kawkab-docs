# Serializations

When building APIs, you often need to convert models and their related relationships into an object or JSON. **Kawkab Kawkab** provides convenient methods to perform these conversions, along with control over the properties included in the serialized representation of the models.

### Model and Collection Serialization

#### Converting to Data Object

To convert a model and its loaded relationships into an array, you can use the `toData` method. This method works recursively, converting all properties and relationships (including nested relationships) into an object:

```javascript
const user = await User.query().with('roles').first();

return user.toData();
```

You can use the `attributesToData` method to convert only the modelâ€™s attributes into an object without including relationships:

```javascript
const user = await User.query().first();
 
return user.attributesToData();
```

You can also convert entire collections of models into a data object using the `toData` method on the collection instance:

```javascript
const users = await User.query().all();
 
return users.toData();
```

#### Converting to JSON

To convert a model to JSON, you can use the `toJson` method. Similar to `toData`, the `toJson` method works recursively, converting all properties and relationships into JSON. You can also specify supported encoding options in JavaScript:

```javascript
const user = await User.query().find(1);
 
return user.toJson();
 
return user.toJson(null, 2);
```

Alternatively, you can convert a model or collection into a string, which will automatically call the `toJson` method:

```javascript
const user = await User.query().find(1);

return String(user);

return JSON.stringify(user);
```

Since models and collections are converted to JSON when converted to a string, you can return **Kawkab Kawkab** objects directly from `express` or `Koa` applications. **Kawkab Kawkab** will automatically serialize models and collections into JSON when returned from routes or controllers:

```javascript
const app = require('express')();

app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.query().find(1);

  res.send(user);
});
```

**Relationships**

When a **Kawkab Kawkab** model is converted to JSON, its loaded relationships are automatically included as properties inside the JSON object.

### Hiding Properties from JSON

Sometimes, you may want to restrict properties (such as passwords) from being included in the model's data object or JSON representation. To achieve this, add a `hidden` property to the model. Properties listed in the `hidden` array will be excluded from the serialized representation of the model:

```javascript
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class User extends Model {
  hidden = ['password'];
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `visible` property to define a "whitelist" of properties that should be included in the model's data object and JSON representation. All properties not listed in the `visible` array will be hidden:

```javascript
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class User extends Model {
  visible = ['first_name', 'last_name'];
}
```

**Temporarily Modify Property Visibility**

If you want to make properties that are usually hidden visible for a particular model instance, you can use the `makeVisible` method. This method returns the model instance:

```javascript
user.makeVisible('attribute').toData();

user.makeVisible(['attribute', 'another_attribute']).toData();
```

Similarly, if you want to hide properties that are usually visible, you can use the `makeHidden` method:

```javascript
user.makeHidden('attribute').toData();

user.makeHidden(['attribute', 'another_attribute']).toData();
```

If you want to override all visible or hidden properties temporarily, you can use the `setVisible` and `setHidden` methods respectively:

```javascript
user.setVisible(['id', 'name']).toData();

user.setHidden(['email', 'password', 'remember_token']).toData();
```

### Appending Values to JSON

Sometimes, when converting models to a data object or JSON, you may want to add properties that do not have a corresponding column in the database. To achieve this, first define an appended value:

```javascript
import { BaseModel, AttributeModel } from "kawkab";

class User extends Model {
  attributeIsAdmin() {
    return Attribute.make({
      get: (value, attributes) => (attributes.admin === 'yes')
    });
  }
}
```

After defining the appended value, add the property name to the model's `appends` property. Note that property names are usually used in "snake_case" in the serialized representation, even if the appended value is defined in "camelCase":

```javascript
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class User extends Model {
  appends = ['is_admin'];
}
```

Once the property is added to the `appends` list, it will be included in both the data object and JSON representations. Properties in the `appends` array will also respect the model's `visible` and `hidden` settings.

**Appending Values at Runtime**

At runtime, you can tell a model instance to append additional properties using the `append` method. Or you can use the `setAppends` method to override the entire array of appended properties for the model instance:

```javascript
user.append('is_admin').toData();
 
user.setAppends(['is_admin']).toData();
```
