# Hooks

Kawkab models trigger several events, allowing you to hook into the following moments in the model's lifecycle: `creating`, `created`, `updating`, `updated`, `saving`, `saved`, `deleting`, `deleted`, `restoring`, `restored`, `trashed`, `forceDeleting`, and `forceDeleted`.

Events ending with `-ing` are fired before any changes are saved to the model, while events ending with `-ed` are fired after the changes are saved.

## Available Hooks

| Hook                             | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `creating`, `created`            | When a new model is saved for the first time                                                  |
| `updating`, `updated`            | When an existing model is modified and the `save` method is called                            |
| `saving`, `saved`                | When a model is being created or updated - even if no changes have occurred in the model      |
| `deleting`, `deleted`            | When a model is being deleted, including soft deletes                                        |
| `restoring`, `restored`          | When a model is restored (after a soft delete)                                                |
| `trashed`                        | When a model is soft deleted                                                                  |
| `forceDeleting`, `forceDeleted`  | When a model is permanently deleted                                                           |

:::tip
When executing a bulk update or delete query via Kawkab, the `saved`, `updated`, `deleting`, and `deleted` events will not be triggered for the affected models. This is because the models are not actually retrieved during bulk updates or deletes.

## Declaring Hooks

Currently, there are two ways to add hooks programmatically:

```js
class User extends Model {}

User.creating(user => {
  // logic to run before creating
});
```

```js
class User {
  static booted() {
    this.creating(user => {
      // logic to run before creating
    });

    this.created(user => {
      // logic to run after created
    });
  }
}
```

## Hooks and Transactions

```js
User.deleted(async (user, { client }) => {
  const query = user.related('posts');

  if (client) {
    query.transacting(client);
  }

  await query.delete();
});

const trx = await Kawkab.beginTransaction();

await user.delete({
  client: trx
});

await trx.commit();
```

In the example above, we handle related model deletions within the transaction, ensuring consistency and atomicity when deleting a user and their related posts.
