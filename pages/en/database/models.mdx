# Models

KawkabJS models are built on the active record pattern.

Kawkab's data model layer makes it very easy to implement CRUD operations and manage relationships between models.

We recommend using models extensively and resorting to the standard query builder for special use cases.

### Creating Your First Model

Let's take a look at a basic model class and discuss some of the main conventions in Kawkab:

```js
const { Model } = "kawkab";

class Flight extends Model {
  //
}
```

#### Table Names

After looking at the example above, you might have noticed that we did not tell Kawkab which database table matches our `Flight` model. By convention, the plural name of the class in snake case will be used as the table name unless another name is explicitly specified. Therefore, in this case, Kawkab will assume that the `Flight` model stores records in a `flights` table, while an `AirTrafficController` model would store records in an `air_traffic_controllers` table.

If the database table for your model does not follow this convention, you may explicitly specify the model's table name by defining a `table` property on the model:

```js
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class Flight extends Model {
  // The table associated with the model.
  table = 'my_flights';
}
```

#### Primary Keys

Kawkab will also assume that each database table has a primary key column named `id`. If necessary, you may define a protected `primaryKey` property on your model to specify a different column that should serve as the model's primary key:

```js
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class Flight extends Model {
  // The primary key associated with the table.
  primaryKey = 'flight_id';
}
```

If you wish to use a non-incrementing or non-numeric primary key, you should define an `incrementing` property on your model which is set to false:

```js
class Flight extends Model {
  // Indicates if the model's ID is auto-incrementing.
  incrementing = false;
}
```

If your model's primary key is not an integer, you should define a `keyType` property on your model. This property should contain a string value:

```js
class Flight extends Model {
  // The data type of the auto-incrementing ID.
  keyType = 'string';
}
```

#### Timestamps

By default, Sutando expects `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to exist on your model's corresponding database table. Sutando will automatically set the values of these columns when models are created or updated. If you do not want these columns to be managed automatically by Sutando, you should define a `timestamps` property on your model with a value of false:

```js
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class Flight extends Model {
  // Indicates if the model should be timestamped.
  timestamps = false;
}
```

If you need to customize the names of the columns used to store the timestamps, you can set `CREATED_AT` and `UPDATED_AT` properties on your model:

```js
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class Flight extends Model {
  static CREATED_AT = 'creation_date';
  static UPDATED_AT = 'updated_date';
}
```

#### Database Connections

By default, all Sutando models will use the `default` database connection configured for your application. If you would like to specify a different connection to be used when interacting with a given model, you should define a `connection` property on the model:

```js
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class Flight extends Model {
  connection = 'sqlite';
}
```

#### Default Attribute Values

By default, a newly created model instance will not have any attribute values. If you would like to specify default values for some of your model's attributes, you may define an `attributes` property on the model. The attribute values placed in `attributes` should be in their raw, "storage-ready" form as if they were just read from the database:

```js
import { BaseModel } from "kawkab";

class Flight extends Model {
  attributes = {
    options: '[]',
    delayed: false,
  };
}
```

### Retrieving Models

Once you have created a model and its associated database table, you are ready to start retrieving data from your database. You may think of each Sutando model as a powerful query builder allowing you to fluently query the database table associated with the model. The `all` method of the model will retrieve all records from the model's associated database table:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./models');

const flights = await Flight.query().all();

flights.map(flight => {
  console.log(flight.name)
})
```

**Building Queries**

The Sutando `all` method will retrieve all of the results in the model's table. However, since every Sutando model serves as a query builder, you may add additional constraints to the queries, and then use the `get`/`first`/`find` method to retrieve the results:

```js
const flights = await Flight.query().where('active', 1)
  .orderBy('name')
  .take(10)
  .get();

const flight = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).first();

const flight = await Flight.query().find(5);
```

**Updating Models**

If you already have a Sutando model instance retrieved from the database, you can "refresh" the model using the `fresh` and `refresh` methods. The `fresh` method will retrieve a fresh model instance from the database. The current model instance will be unaffected:

```js
const flight = await Flight.query().where('number', 'FR 900').first();

const freshFlight = await flight.fresh();
```

The `refresh` method will re-populate the current model using fresh data from the database. Additionally, all loaded relationships will be refreshed as well:

```js
const flight = await Flight.query().where('number', 'FR 900').first();

flight.number = 'FR 456';

await flight.refresh();

flight.number; // "FR 900"
```

#### Collections

As we saw, Sutando methods like `all` and `get` retrieve multiple records from the database. However, these methods do not return a plain array. Instead, an instance of `Collection` is returned.

The Sutando `Collection` class extends the [`collect.js`](https://collect.js.org/) class, which provides a variety of useful methods for interacting with collections of data. For example, the `reject` method may be used to remove models from the collection based on the result of a closure:

```js
const flights = await Flight.query().where('destination', 'Paris').get();

const newFlights = flights.reject(flight => {
  return flight.cancelled;
});
```

In addition to the methods provided by the base `collect.js` collection class, the Sutando collection class provides a few additional methods that are specifically tailored for interacting with collections of Sutando models.

Since all Sutando collections implement JavaScript's iterable interfaces, you may loop over the collections as if they were an array:

```js
for (let flight of flights) {
  console.log(flight.name);
}
```

#### Chunking Results

If you need to process thousands of Sutando records, you may run into memory issues if you attempt to load them all at once via the `all` or `get` methods. Instead of using these methods, you may use the `chunk` method.

The `chunk` method will retrieve a subset of Sutando models, passing them to a closure for processing. Since only the current chunk of Sutando models is retrieved at any one time, the `chunk` method will provide significantly lower memory usage when working with a large number of models:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./models');

await Flight.query().chunk(200, flights => {
  flights.map(flight => {
    //
  });
});
```

### Retrieving Single Models / Aggregates

In addition to retrieving all records that match a given query, you may also retrieve single records using the `find` or `first` methods. Instead of returning a collection of models, these methods return a single model instance:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./modles');

// Retrieve a model by its primary key...
const flight = await Flight.query().find(1);

// Retrieve the first model matching the query constraints...
const flight = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).first();
```
#### Retrieving Or Creating Models

The `firstOrCreate` method will attempt to locate a database record using the given column / value pairs. If the model cannot be found in the database, a record will be inserted with the attributes resulting from merging the first argument with the optional second argument:

The `firstOrNew` method, like `firstOrCreate`, will attempt to locate a record in the database matching the given attributes. However, if a model is not found, a new model instance will be returned. Note that the model returned by `firstOrNew` has not yet been saved to the database. You will need to manually call the `save` method to save it:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./modles');

// Retrieve the flight by name or create it if it doesn't exist...
const flight = await Flight.query().firstOrCreate({
  name: 'London to Paris'
});

// Retrieve the flight by name or create it with the name, delayed, and arrival time...
const flight = await Flight.query().firstOrCreate(
  { name: 'London to Paris' },
  { delayed: 1, arrival_time: '11:30' }
);

// Retrieve the flight by name or create a new flight instance...
const flight = await Flight.query().firstOrNew({
  name: 'London to Paris'
});

// Retrieve the flight by name or create it with the name, delayed, and arrival time...
const flight = await Flight.query().firstOrNew(
  { name: 'Tokyo to Sydney' },
  { delayed: 1, arrival_time: '11:30' }
);
```

#### Retrieving Aggregates

When interacting with Sutando models, you may also use the `count`, `sum`, `max`, and other aggregate methods provided by the query builder. As you might expect, these methods return a single aggregate value instead of a Sutando model instance:

```js
const count = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).count(); // 100

const max = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).max('price'); // 104

const flight = await Flight.query().find(1); // flight instanceof Flight
```

### Inserting & Updating Models

#### Inserts

Of course, when using Sutando, we don't just need to retrieve models from the database. We also need to insert new records. Luckily, Sutando makes it simple. To insert a new record into the database, you should create a new model instance and set the attributes on the model. Then, call the `save` method on the model instance:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./model');

  const flight = new Flight;
  flight.name = req.name;
  await flight.save();

  res.send(flight);
```

In this example, we are setting the name field from the incoming HTTP request to the `name` attribute of the `Flight` model instance. When we call the `save` method, a record will be inserted into the database. The `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps will be automatically set when the `save` method is called, so there is no need to set them manually.

Alternatively, you may use the `create` method to "save" a new model using a single PHP statement. The inserted model instance will be returned by the `create` method:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./model');

const flight = await Flight.query().create({
  name: 'London to Paris',
});
```

#### Updates

The `save` method may also be used to update models that already exist in the database. To update a model, you should retrieve it and set any attributes you wish to update. Then, you should call the model's `save` method. Again, the `updated_at` timestamp will be automatically updated, so there is no need to set its value manually:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./model');

const flight = await Flight.query().find(1);
flight.name = 'Paris to London';
await flight.save();
```

**Mass Updates**

Updates can also be performed against any model matching a given query. In this example, all flights that are `active` and have a `destination` of `San Diego` will be marked as delayed:

```js
await Flight.query().where('active', 1)
  .where('destination', 'San Diego')
  .update({
    delayed: 1,
  });
```

The `update` method expects an array of column and value pairs representing the columns that should be updated. The `update` method returns the number of affected rows.

:::tip When issuing a mass update, the `saving`, `saved`, `updating`, and `updated` model events will not be fired for the updated models. This is because the models are not actually retrieved when issuing a mass update. :::

**Checking Attribute Changes**

Sutando provides `isDirty` methods to inspect the internal state of your model and determine how its attributes have changed from when the model was originally retrieved.

The `isDirty` method determines if any attributes have been changed since the model was retrieved. You may pass a specific attribute name or an array of attributes to the `isDirty` method to determine if any of the attributes are "dirty". This method also accepts an optional attribute parameter:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./model');

const user = await User.query().create({
  first_name: 'Taylor',
  last_name: 'Otwell',
  title: 'Developer',
});

user.title = 'Painter';

user.isDirty(); // true
user.isDirty('title'); // true
user.isDirty('first_name'); // false
user.isDirty(['first_name', 'title']); // true

await user.save();

user.isDirty(); // false
```

#### Upserts

Sometimes you may need to update an existing model or create a new model if none exists. Like the `firstOrCreate` method, the `updateOrCreate` method will save the model, so there is no need to call the `save` method manually.

In the example below, if there is already a flight with a departure of Oakland and a destination of San Diego, the `price` and `discounted` columns will be updated. If no such flight exists, a new flight will be created with the attributes resulting from merging the first argument's object with the second argument's object:

```js
const flight = await Flight.query().updateOrCreate(
  {
    departure: 'Oakland',
    destination: 'San Diego'
  },
  {
    price: 99,
    discounted: 1
  }
);
```

### Deleting Models

To delete a model, you may call the `delete` method on a model instance:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./models');

const flight = await Flight.query().find(1);
await flight.delete();
```

**Deleting An Existing Model By Its Primary Key**

In the example above, we are retrieving the model from the database before calling the `delete` method. However, if you know the primary key of the model, you may delete the model without explicitly retrieving it by calling the `destroy` method. In addition to accepting a single primary key, the `destroy` method will accept multiple primary keys, an array of primary keys, or a `Collection` of primary keys:

```js
await Flight.query().destroy(1);

await Flight.query().destroy(1, 2, 3);

await Flight.query().destroy([1, 2, 3]);
```

**Deleting Models By Query**

Of course, you may build a Sutando query to delete all models matching your query's criteria. In this example, we will delete all flights that are marked as inactive. Like mass updates, mass deletes will not fire model events for the deleted models:

```js
const deleted = await Flight.query().where('active', 0).delete();
```

#### Soft Deleting

In addition to actually removing records from your database, Sutando can also "soft delete" models. When models are soft deleted, they are not actually removed from your database. Instead, a `deleted_at` attribute will be set on the model indicating the date and time at which the model was "deleted". To enable soft deletes for a model, use the `SoftDeletes` mixin and add a `deleted_at` field to your corresponding database table:

```js
const { Model, compose, SoftDeletes } = "kawkab";

class Flight extends compose(Model, SoftDeletes) {
  // ...
}
```

Now, when the `delete` method is called on the model, the `deleted_at` column will be set to the current date and time. However, the model's database record will remain in the table. When querying a model that uses soft deletes, the soft deleted models will automatically be excluded from all query results.

To determine if a given model instance has been soft deleted, you may use the `trashed` method:

```js
if (flight.trashed()) {
  //
}
```

**Restoring Soft Deleted Models**

Sometimes you may wish to "un-delete" a soft deleted model. To restore a soft deleted model into an active state, you may call the `restore` method on a model instance. The `restore` method will set the model's `deleted_at` column to `null`:

```js
await flight.restore();
```

You may also use the `restore` method in a query to restore multiple models. Again, like other "mass" operations, this operation will not fire any model events for the restored models:

```js
await Flight.query().withTrashed()
  .where('airline_id', 1)
  .restore();
```

The `restore` method may also be used when building relationship queries:

```js
await flight.related('history').restore();
```

**Permanently Deleting Models**

Sometimes you may need to truly remove a model from your database. You may use the `forceDelete` method to permanently remove a model from the database:

```js
await flight.forceDelete();
```

You may also use the `forceDelete` method when building Sutando relationship queries:

```js
await flight.related('history').forceDelete();
```

#### Querying Soft Deleted Models

**Including Soft Deleted Models**

As noted above, soft deleted models will automatically be excluded from query results. However, you may force soft deleted models to be included in a query's results by calling the `withTrashed` method on the query:

```js
const { Flight } = require('./models');

const flights = await Flight.query().withTrashed()
  .where('account_id', 1)
  .get();
```

The `withTrashed` method may also be called when building a relationship query:

```js
await flight.related('history').withTrashed().get();
```

**Retrieving Only Soft Deleted Models**

The `onlyTrashed` method will retrieve only soft deleted models:

```js
const flights = await Flight.query().onlyTrashed()
  .where('airline_id', 1)
  .get();
```

### Query Scopes

Scopes allow you to define common sets of query constraints that you may easily re-use throughout your application. For example, you may need to frequently retrieve all users that are considered "popular". To define a scope, prefix a model method with `scope`:

Scopes should always return a query builder instance or void:

```js
const { Model } = require('./models');

class User extends Model {
  scopePopular(query){
    return query.where('votes', '>', 100);
  }

  scopeActive(query){
    query.where('active', 1);
  }
}
```

#### Using A Scope

Once the scope has been defined, you may call the scope methods when querying the model. However, you should not include the `scope` prefix when calling the method. You may even chain calls to different scopes:

```js
const { User } = require('./models');

const users = await User.query().popular().active().orderBy('created_at').get();
```

Combining multiple Sutando model scopes via an `or` query builder operator requires the use of a closure to achieve the proper logical grouping:

```js
const users = await User.query().popular().orWhere(query => {
  query.active();
}).get();
```

#### Dynamic Scopes

Sometimes you may wish to define a scope that accepts parameters. To get started, simply add the additional parameters you need to your scope method's signature. Scope parameters should be defined after the `query` parameter:

```js
const { Model } = require('./models');

class User extends Model {
  scopeOfType(query, type){
    return query.where('type', type);
  }
}
```

Once you have added the expected parameters to your scope method's signature, you may pass the arguments when calling the scope:

```js
const users = await User.query().ofType('admin').get();
```

### Comparing Models

Sometimes you may need to determine if two models are "the same". The `is` and `isNot` methods can be used to quickly verify if two models have the same primary key, table, and database connection:

```js
if (post.is(anotherPost)) {
  //
}

if (post.isNot(anotherPost)) {
  //
}
```
