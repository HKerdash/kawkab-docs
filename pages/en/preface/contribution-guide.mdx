# ðŸŒŸ **Contribution Guidelines for Kawkab Kawkab**

We welcome contributions to all **Kawkab Kawkab** projects. Before contributing, please read these guidelines carefully.

## Ways to Contribute
Programming is not the only way to contribute. Here are some other ways you can help the project and the community:

- Fixing typos in the documentation
- Improving existing documentation
- Writing educational articles or blog posts to raise awareness among members
- Assisting in issue triaging
- Sharing your opinion on existing issues
- Helping in the community via Discord or discussion forums
- Reporting bugs

## Reporting Bugs
Many issues reported in open-source projects are often user-side setup issues or questions. We strongly recommend properly diagnosing the issue before reporting it.

### How to Report an Issue:
- **Ideal Issue**: Isolate the core bug, create a failing test within the repository, and open an issue on GitHub about it.
- **Good Issue**: Isolate the core bug and provide a minimal reproduction on a GitHub repository.
- **Reasonable Issue**: Properly identify the problem and share the code that caused the issue.

## Getting Started with Contributions
If you want to make a contribution through a Pull Request, it is preferred to start with a discussion to understand the project better before working on the code.

- If youâ€™re fixing a bug: The issue should have been confirmed as a bug.
- If youâ€™re adding a new feature: Please explain why the feature is needed.

## Setting Up the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
npm install
```

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Tools Used
Here are the tools used across all projects:

| Tool           | Purpose                                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| TypeScript     | All repositories are written in TypeScript.    |
| ESLint         | Ensures code style consistency across repositories. |
| Prettier       | Formats code uniformly.                        |

## Code Formatting
Before pushing your code to the repository, ensure it is formatted using the following tools:

- To format code with Prettier:
```bash
npm run format
```
- To lint code with ESLint:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## How to Get Recognized as a Contributor
We rely on GitHub to showcase all contributors to the repository. If your contribution is significant, your name will be included in the release notes.
