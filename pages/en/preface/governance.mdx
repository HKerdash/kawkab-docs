# üèõÔ∏è **Managing Kawkab Framework**

### **Authors**
**@Hassan Kerdash** is the author of **Kawkab Framework**, responsible for managing the project, setting development standards, and determining the project's overall direction. This includes:

- Deciding on new projects to be included in the Kawkab Framework.
- Assigning project leaders, guiding them as needed, and transferring leadership when a current leader steps down.
- Documenting the framework's vision and sharing it with other leaders and the community.

### **Project Leaders**
The Kawkab Framework consists of a set of packages created and managed by the core team. Each package has a project leader assigned by the author.

In most cases, the package creator becomes the project leader due to their initial efforts in developing the idea.

- The leader is the person who makes the final decisions on all aspects of the project.
- The leader is responsible for setting the strategic goals of the project and clearly communicating them to the community.
- The leader must also interact with the community to address their diverse needs and ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.

### **Core Team**
Core team members are contributors who have made significant contributions to the project and are relied upon for writing code and conducting reviews.

- Core team members are often tasked with specific responsibilities, such as fixing bugs, developing new features, or improving documentation.
- They do not have the authority to make decisions for the entire project but often have a significant impact on its direction.

### **Active Core Team Members**
Active core team members contribute regularly to the project, handling tasks such as reviewing issues, fixing bugs, or improving documentation.

### **Honorary Core Team Members**
Some members who have made significant contributions in the past may no longer be able to participate at the same level. These members are honored with the title of "Honorary Core Team Members" and are welcome to contribute whenever they choose.

### **Contributors**
Contributors are community members who do not seek to become part of the core team but still provide valuable input, such as reporting bugs, adding new features, or improving the project's infrastructure.

Contributing does not require commitment or specific skills, and anyone can become a contributor simply by working on useful tasks for the project.

### **Users**
Users are the most important members of the community. Without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user, with no specific requirements.

Users should be encouraged to engage with the community, such as spreading the word about the project or offering moral support.

### **Support**
We encourage all community members to provide support to new users. This support is voluntary and provided through the project's designated channels.

### **Financial Donations**
In open-source projects, financial donations are not as important as active contributions but remain a valuable option for individuals or organizations that lack time but have the financial capacity to support the project.

You can support us through donations on platforms like **GitHub Sponsors**.

### **Trademark and Ownership**
**Kawkab Framework** is a trademark referring to the framework under the name **@Hassan Kerdash**. The name or logo of Kawkab Framework must not be used in a way that could mislead users or imply an unofficial affiliation with the project.

### **Projects Under Kawkab Framework**
Projects that join the **Kawkab Framework** become intellectual property of the author. Once a project is added under the Kawkab Framework umbrella, the leader cannot delete or abandon the project.
