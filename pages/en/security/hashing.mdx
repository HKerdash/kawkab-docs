# Hashing Encryption in Kawkab Kawkab

In the world of modern application development, hashing is a fundamental tool to ensure the security of sensitive data such as passwords, secret keys, or other confidential information. In **Kawkab Kawkab**, we offer two main functions for handling encryption:

- **`hash.generate`**: To generate a hash of the data.
- **`hash.verify`**: To verify the correctness of the data compared to the hash.

## What is Hashing?

Hashing is the process of transforming data into a unique string of characters (hash) using specific algorithms. This string cannot be reversed to the original data, making it ideal for securing sensitive data.

### Uses of Hashing:
1. **Securing passwords**: Passwords are hashed and stored in the database instead of saving them as plain text.
2. **Integrity checking**: Used to confirm that data has not been modified during transmission.
3. **Digital signatures**: To ensure the identity of the sender.

## How Does Hashing Work in **Kawkab Kawkab**?

### 1. Generating Hash Using `hash.generate`

The **`hash.generate`** function is used to create a hash for the data. A strong encryption algorithm is applied to produce a unique string.

#### Example:
```ts
import { hash } from "kawkab";

const password = "123456";
const hashedPassword = await hash.generate(password);

console.log(hashedPassword);
// Output: A hashed string like: "$2b$10$E8s1h...abc123"
```

#### Additional Options:
You can customize the encryption strength (salt rounds) based on security requirements.

```ts
const strongHash = await hash.generate(password, 10);
console.log(strongHash);
```

### 2. Verifying Hash Using `hash.verify`

The **`hash.verify`** function is used to compare the original data with the hashed version to ensure they match.

#### Example:
```ts
import { hash } from "kawkab";

const password = "123456";
const hashedPassword = await hash.generate(password);

// Verify the entered password
const isMatch = await hash.verify(password, hashedPassword);

if (isMatch) {
    console.log("Password is correct.");
} else {
    console.log("Password is incorrect.");
}
```

#### Use Cases:
- Verifying password correctness during login.
- Verifying the integrity of data during file transfers.

## Additional Options When Using `hash.generate` and `hash.verify`

### 1. **Hashing with Salt Rounds**
The ability to specify the number of hashing rounds (Salt Rounds) to make the hash more secure. The more rounds, the stronger the encryption (but it takes longer).

```ts
const customHashed = await hash.generate("mySecurePassword", 14);
```

### 2. **Verification with Custom Options**
The `hash.verify` function works smoothly with default values but can be customized when needed.

## Practical Examples

### A) Storing Passwords During Registration
```ts
import { hash } from "kawkab";

async function registerUser(username: string, password: string) {
    const hashedPassword = await hash.generate(password);
    // Save the username and hashed password in the database
    console.log(`User registered: ${username}, with hashed password: ${hashedPassword}`);
}

registerUser("Hassan", "password123");
```

---

### B) Verifying Password During Login
```ts
import { hash } from "kawkab";

async function loginUser(inputPassword: string, storedHash: string) {
    const isMatch = await hash.verify(inputPassword, storedHash);

    if (isMatch) {
        console.log("Login successful.");
    } else {
        console.log("Login failed. Incorrect password.");
    }
}

// Example
loginUser("password123", "$2b$10$E8s1h...abc123");
```

---

### C) Using Hashing to Secure Files
```ts
import { hash } from "kawkab";

async function secureFile(fileContent: string) {
    const fileHash = await hash.generate(fileContent);
    console.log(`File hash generated: ${fileHash}`);
}

secureFile("This is the content of the secret file.");
```

---

## Practical Tips
- Always store passwords as hashes in the database.
- Use a sufficient number of **Salt Rounds** (usually between 10-14) to ensure encryption security.
- Do not store hashes in a place that can be easily accessed.

## Comparison Between **hash.generate** and **hash.verify**
| Function          | Purpose                                     | Inputs                           | Output                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **hash.generate**  | Create a hashed fingerprint                 | Plain text + Options (optional)  | Hashed string                 |
| **hash.verify**    | Verify the matching of the text with the hash | Plain text + Hashed fingerprint   | `true` if matched, or `false` |

In this way, you can achieve a high level of security using **Hashing** in **Kawkab Kawkab**, ensuring the protection of user data and applications.
