# Rate Limiter in Kawkab JS

A **Rate Limiter** is used to control the number of requests a client can send to the server within a specific time period. This helps prevent attacks like **Denial of Service (DoS)** and protects your application from excessive resource consumption due to repeated requests from the same client.

### Configuring Rate Limiter

You can configure the **Rate Limiter** settings through the main configuration file `app/configuration.ts`. This file provides full control over the maximum number of allowed requests and the time window for each client.

#### Rate Limiter Settings

```typescript
import { env } from "kawkab";
import { Provider } from "./provider";

// Main configuration object for the application
export const app = {
  // Rate limiter configuration
  rateLimiter: {
    // Enable or disable the rate limiter
    enable: true,

    // Maximum number of requests allowed within the defined time window
    maxRequests: 100,

    // Time window (in milliseconds) for rate limiting, default is 1 minute (60 * 1000)
    windowTime: 60 * 1000,

    // Error code sent when rate limit is exceeded
    code: "too-many-requests",

    // Message displayed when rate limit is exceeded
    message: "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
  },
};
```

### Explanation of Settings:

- **`enable`**: Determines whether the Rate Limiter is enabled or not. If set to `true`, the system is activated. If set to `false`, it is disabled.
- **`maxRequests`**: The maximum number of requests that a user can send within a specified time period (defined by the `windowTime`).
- **`windowTime`**: The time window (in milliseconds) within which the request rate is limited. The default is 60 seconds (60,000 milliseconds).
- **`code`**: The error code that will be sent as a response when the client exceeds the allowed request limit.
- **`message`**: The message that will be displayed to the user when the request limit is exceeded.

### Summary

The **Rate Limiter** helps protect your application from attacks based on sending large numbers of requests in a short period. With customizable settings in `configuration.ts`, you can define the maximum number of requests and the time window during which requests are allowed. This improves server security and enhances the user experience.

**Note:** Ensure that the **Rate Limiter** settings align with your applicationâ€™s needs and the volume of traffic you expect.
