# Handling **Passwords** in Kawkab

In the world of modern application development, **password protection** is crucial to ensure the security of user data. In the **Kawkab** framework, we provide custom functions to easily and securely hash and verify passwords.

## **What is the Password Protection Process?**

Password protection involves converting plain text passwords into **encrypted hash values** using strong algorithms.  
### Features of this process:
1. **Non-readability**: The hashed password cannot be read directly.
2. **Security consistency**: Secure algorithms are used to ensure data protection.
3. **Quick verification**: The password can be verified without knowing the original text.

## **Password Functions in Kawkab**

### 1. **`hash`**
A function used to generate an **encrypted hash of the password**.  
- It uses advanced algorithms to generate the hash.
- It is recommended to use this during the registration or password update process.

#### **Example:**
```ts
import { password } from "kawkab";

const myPassword = "MySecurePassword123";
const hashedPassword = await password.hash(myPassword);

console.log(hashedPassword); 
// Output: A hashed string like: "$2b$10$XfT...9lmJ"
```

#### **Additional Options:**
You can customize the encryption strength (Salt Rounds) to ensure more security.
```ts
const strongHash = await password.hash(password, 12);
```

---

### 2. **`verify`**
A function used to compare the entered password with the stored hash to verify its validity.  
- It is used during login or other operations that require verification.

#### **Example:**
```ts
import { password } from "kawkab";

const myPassword = "MySecurePassword123";
const hashedPassword = await password.hash(myPassword);

const isValid = await password.verify(myPassword, hashedPassword);

if (isValid) {
    console.log("Password is correct.");
} else {
    console.log("Password is incorrect.");
}
```

## **Practical Uses of Passwords in Applications**

### **1. Registering New Users**
When registering a user, the password is hashed before storing it in the database.
```ts
import { password } from "kawkab";

async function registerUser(username: string, password: string) {
    const hashedPassword = password.hash(password);
    console.log(`User ${username} has been registered with an encrypted password: ${hashedPassword}`);
}

registerUser("Hassan", "Password123!");
```

---

### **2. Logging In**
When attempting to log in, the entered password is compared to the stored hash.
```ts
import { password } from "kawkab";

async function loginUser(inputPassword: string, storedHash: string) {
    const isMatch = await password.verify(inputPassword, storedHash);

    if (isMatch) {
        console.log("Logged in successfully.");
    } else {
        console.log("Incorrect password.");
    }
}

// Example
loginUser("Password123!", "$2b$10$XfT...9lmJ");
```

## **Comparison of `hash` and `verify`**

| Function     | Inputs                     | Output             | Usage                           |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| **`hash`**   | Plain text password         | Hashed password    | Hashing passwords during registration |
| **`verify`** | Plain text password + hash  | `true` or `false`  | Verification during login       |

---

## **Practical Tips**
- **Do not store passwords as plain text.** Always use the `hash` function to encrypt them.
- Set the number of salt rounds between 10-14 for a balance between performance and security.
- During verification, only use the `verify` function to compare passwords.

By using the **Kawkab** functions dedicated to password protection, you can ensure a high level of security for your users and reduce security risks.
