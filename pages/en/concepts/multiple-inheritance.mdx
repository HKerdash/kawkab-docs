# **Multiple Inheritance in Kawkab**

In **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, multiple inheritance is not directly supported, which presents a challenge for developers who need to combine multiple behaviors from different objects or services. However, **Kawkab** has introduced an innovative solution to this problem using the `inherit` function, enabling multiple inheritance in a flexible and easy way.

---

## **What is Multiple Inheritance?**

Multiple inheritance is a programming pattern that allows you to make one object inherit from multiple objects or classes simultaneously. In languages that directly support multiple inheritance (like C++), an object can easily obtain properties and behaviors from multiple sources. However, **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** don't directly support this pattern; they only allow objects to inherit from a single object.

---

## **The Multiple Inheritance Problem in JavaScript and TypeScript**

In **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, objects can only inherit from one object. For example, you can't write something like:

```ts
class Child extends ParentA, ParentB {}
```

This limitation is not supported in **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**. However, if you have multiple classes with shared functions or behaviors you want to combine, there are alternative solutions like using **Mixins** or **Prototype-based inheritance**.

---

## **The Solution in Kawkab Using `inherit`**

The `inherit` function in **Kawkab** allows you to combine multiple behaviors from multiple classes into a single class, providing a flexible solution for multiple inheritance. This function allows you to easily merge multiple functionalities into one class, enhancing code organization and helping reduce duplication.

### **How Does `inherit` Work?**

The inherit function is used to combine multiple classes together, allowing you to leverage the properties of inherited classes in a new class. inherit can be used with any class whose behaviors you want to combine, enabling dynamic and flexible behavior merging.

## **How to Use Multiple Inheritance in Kawkab?**

### **Example of Multiple Inheritance Using `inherit`**

In this example, we use `inherit` to combine the **BaseService** class and **Inject** class into the **WelcomeService** class.

```ts
import { BaseService, Inject, inherit } from "kawkab";

export class WelcomeService extends inherit(BaseService, Inject) {
    /**
     * Return a welcome message
     * @returns {string} The welcome message
     */
    message() {
        return "Welcome to Kawkab Framework ðŸš€!";
    }
}
```

### **Example Explanation:**

1. **BaseService**: Contains the basic functions needed by application services.
2. **Inject**: Allows you to inject dependencies into the class, making object management easier within the application.
3. **inherit**: Combines the `BaseService` and `Inject` classes into one class, allowing you to use functions from both classes within **WelcomeService**.

---

## **Using Multiple Inheritance in Controllers**

You can use combined classes in **Kawkab** within Controllers. For example, we can use **WelcomeService** that inherits from `BaseService` and `Inject` inside a controller like this:

```ts
import { BaseController, inherit } from "kawkab";
import { WelcomeService } from "../services/welcome";
import { Docs } from "./docs";
import { Middleware } from "./middleware";

export default class extends inherit(BaseController, Middleware, Docs) {
    constructor(private welcomeService = WelcomeService.inject()) {
        super();
    }

    /**
     * GET function to return welcome message
     * @returns {object} JSON response
     */
    async get() {
        return {
            status: true,
            message: this.welcomeService.message(),
        };
    }
}
```

### **Process Explanation:**

1. **Creating a Service:**  
   **WelcomeService** is defined using `inherit` to combine **BaseService**, **Middleware**, and **Docs**.

2. **Injecting the Service:**  
   Inside the controller, `.inject()` is used to call **WelcomeService**.

3. **Using Functions:**  
   After injecting the service, you can call functions like `message()` that were inherited from other classes.

## **Benefits of Multiple Inheritance Using `inherit`**

1. **Reducing Code Duplication:**  
   Using `inherit`, you can combine multiple behaviors into one class, reducing the need for code duplication in your application.

2. **Reusability:**  
   The combined class can be used in different places without needing to recreate it.

3. **Easy Maintenance:**  
   When you need to modify or add new behavior, you can modify the original class instead of modifying multiple objects.

4. **Design Flexibility:**  
   `inherit` gives you great flexibility in combining classes without worrying about single inheritance constraints.

---

## **Best Practices for Using Multiple Inheritance**

1. **Use `inherit` Moderately:**  
   Make sure you need to combine multiple functions from multiple sources. If some functions are unnecessary, it might be better to keep them separate.

2. **Organize Classes Well:**  
   Make sure to organize classes in appropriate folders, like `/services` and `/controllers`, for easy maintenance.

3. **Using `inherit`:**  
   Ensure you use inheritance in an organized and effective way to ensure future scalability.

4. **Unit Testing:**  
   Use **Mock Services** when testing units to ensure test coverage for all possible scenarios.

---

## **Summary**

Multiple inheritance is a concept not directly supported in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. However, using **Kawkab** and the `inherit` function, you can combine multiple behaviors from several objects into a single class. This solution provides great flexibility and makes code management easier in large applications, while reducing duplication and enhancing maintainability.
