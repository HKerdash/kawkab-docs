# **Dependency Injection in Kawkab**

The **Kawkab** framework provides a built-in and easy-to-use system for **Dependency Injection** to manage application objects and services in an organized way, enhancing testability, reusability, and reducing code duplication.

---

## **What is Dependency Injection?**

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows dependencies (such as objects and services) to be passed into **Classes** dynamically rather than being created within the class itself. This promotes separation between components and reduces coupling between them.

---

## **Dependency Injection Mechanism in Kawkab**

In **Kawkab**, dependency injection is implemented using a combination of inheriting from `Inject` and the `.inject()` function. This system is provided to support a modular architecture while facilitating object management across the application.

---

## **Using Dependency Injection with Services**

### **1. Defining a Service**
To create a service that uses dependency injection, you must inherit from both `BaseService` and `Inject`.

```ts
import { BaseService, Inject, inherit } from "kawkab";

// Define WelcomeService
export class WelcomeService extends inherit(BaseService, Inject) {
    /**
     * Return a welcome message
     * @returns {string} The welcome message
     */
    message() {
        return "Welcome to Kawkab Framework ðŸš€!";
    }
}
```

### **2. Using the Service in a Controller**
To inject the service into a controller, use the service's `.inject()` function.

```ts
import { BaseController, inherit } from "kawkab";
import { WelcomeService } from "../services/welcome";

// Controller using WelcomeService
export default class extends inherit(BaseController) {
    constructor(private welcomeService = WelcomeService.inject()) {
        super();
    }

    /**
     * GET function to return welcome message
     * @returns {object} JSON response
     */
    async get() {
        return {
            status: true,
            message: this.welcomeService.message(),
        };
    }
}
```

### **Process Explanation**
1. **Creating the Service:**  
   The service is defined using inheritance from `BaseService` and `Inject`.
   
2. **Injecting the Service:**  
   The service is called using `.inject()`, where the service is dynamically injected as a ready-to-use unit.

3. **Using the Service:**  
   Service functions can be called within the controller or any other unit.

---

## **Benefits of Dependency Injection in Kawkab**

1. **Separation of Concerns:**  
   Business logic is isolated from controllers, making the code more organized.

2. **Reusability:**  
   The same service can be used in multiple places without needing to recreate it.

3. **Easy Testing:**  
   Dependencies can be replaced with **Mock Services** during testing.

4. **Reduced Duplication:**  
   Dependencies are created only once and injected when needed.

---

## **Best Practices for Using Dependency Injection**

1. **Organizing Services:**  
   Organize services in dedicated folders, like `/services`, for easy access and maintenance.

2. **Relying on Inheritance:**  
   Inheriting from `Inject` and `BaseService` simplifies service management.

3. **Leveraging `.inject()`:**  
   Use `.inject()` to get the service object without needing to create it manually.

4. **Unit Testing:**  
   Replace dependencies with mock services during testing to ensure coverage of multiple scenarios.

---

## **Practical Example**

### **Service File**
```ts
import { BaseService, Inject, inherit } from "kawkab";

export class WelcomeService extends inherit(BaseService, Inject) {
    message() {
        return "Welcome to Kawkab Framework ðŸš€!";
    }
}
```

### **Controller File**
```ts
import { BaseController, inherit } from "kawkab";
import { WelcomeService } from "../services/welcome";

export default class extends inherit(BaseController) {
    constructor(private welcomeService = WelcomeService.inject()) {
        super();
    }

    async get() {
        return {
            status: true,
            message: this.welcomeService.message(),
        };
    }
}
```

### **Result**

```json
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Welcome to Kawkab Framework ðŸš€!"
}
```

## **Summary**

The **Dependency Injection** system in **Kawkab** is a powerful feature for simplifying dependency management in applications. Using tools like `.inject()` and inheriting from `Inject`, you can create flexible and maintainable applications while reducing the effort required in manually managing dependencies.
