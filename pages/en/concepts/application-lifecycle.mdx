# **Application Lifecycle in Kawkab**

The **Kawkab** framework relies on the concept of **Application Lifecycle** to manage application initialization and request handling in an organized manner. The application lifecycle begins from the initialization point and moves through handling each request.

---

## **Application Initialization**

### **1. Entry Point: `index.ts`**
The `index.ts` file is the entry point for a **Kawkab** application. It imports the framework and initializes the application based on predefined settings.

```ts
import { kawkab } from 'kawkab'
import { app as config } from './app/configuration'

// Initialize the application using settings
export const app = kawkab.init(config)
```

### **2. Configuration File: `configuration.ts`**
This file contains the necessary settings for running the application. The application relies on a **Provider** that is responsible for registering and initializing modules.

```ts
import { Provider } from './provider'

export const app = {
    provider: Provider,
}
```

---

## **Service Provider**

### **Provider's Role**
The provider is responsible for registering the necessary **Modules** for the application and providing the required initialization. It is implemented through a class that inherits from `BaseProvider`.

```ts
import { BaseProvider } from "kawkab"

export class Provider extends BaseProvider {
    /**
     * Current provider path
     * Used to get the current directory path.
     */
    protected currentDir: string = __dirname

    /**
     * Register modules
     * This function is called once when the application starts.
     * Registers and initializes modules needed for the application.
     */
    async register() {
        await this.modules()
    }

    /**
     * Setup with each request
     * This function is called with each new request.
     * Used to register additional settings or services.
     */
    boot() {
        // Write code here
    }
}
```

### **Provider Lifecycle**
1. **Register**:  
   Called only once when the server starts. Used to register modules and perform necessary initializations.
   
2. **Boot**:  
   Called with each new request to handle dynamic settings or request services.

---

## **Application Lifecycle Explanation**

1. **Framework Initialization:**
   - The framework starts when `kawkab.init()` is called in `index.ts`.
   - Application settings are imported from `configuration.ts`.
   
2. **Module Registration:**
   - The provider calls `register()` to register modules needed for the application.

3. **Request Handling:**
   - `boot()` is called with each new request to provide additional services or reinitialize.

---

## **Summary**

The **Kawkab** framework provides a clear and organized application lifecycle, allowing developers to manage module registration and initialization seamlessly. Using the `Provider`, initialization can be customized and high application performance can be ensured when handling requests.
