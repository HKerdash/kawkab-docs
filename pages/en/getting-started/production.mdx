# **Preparing for Production in Kawkab Framework**

After developing your application using **Kawkab**, you'll need to deploy it in a production environment. This guide explains how to set up and run your application using the appropriate commands.

---

## **1. Build the Production Version**

To prepare the application for the production environment, create a compressed and optimized build using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will:

- Generate the final files to be deployed on the server.

The generated build will be saved in the `.dist` directory.

---

## **2. Run the Application in Production Mode**

Once the build process is complete, you can run the application in production mode using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

### **What this command does:**
- Loads the final version of the project.
- Starts the production server.
- Makes the application available at the specified address (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## **3. Important Tips for Production**

### **Environment Settings:**
Ensure that the `.env.production` file contains the appropriate settings for production.

### **Reverse Proxy:**
For better performance and security, consider placing a reverse proxy server like **Nginx** or **Apache** in front of your application.

## **Conclusion**

Once the application is running in production mode, it will be ready to handle users. The **Kawkab** framework offers you flexible and efficient tools to ensure high performance and a great user experience.
