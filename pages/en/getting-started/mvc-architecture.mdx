# MVC Pattern in Kawkab Kawkab

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is a design pattern that divides the application into three main parts. In Kawkab, you can use the `main` module to immediately start implementing this pattern, as it comes with the framework by default and contains everything you need.

## Key Components

### 1. Model
- **M** stands for Model
- Represents the data and business logic
- Interacts with the database
- Example:
```typescript
// app/modules/main/models/User.ts
export class User extends Model {
    // Contains the definition of data and business logic
}
```

### 2. View
- **V** stands for View
- Represents the user interface
- Displays data to the user
- Example:
```typescript
{
    "message": "Hello",
    "data": {
        "name": "Ahmed",
        "email": "ahmed@example.com"
    }
}
```

### 3. Controller
- **C** stands for Controller
- Handles user requests
- Controls the flow of data
- Example:
```typescript
// app/modules/main/controllers/users/index.ts
export default class extends BaseController {
    // Handles requests and processes them
    get() {
        return {
            message: "Hello",
            data: {
                name: "Ahmed",
                email: "ahmed@example.com"
            }
        };
    }
}
```

## Folder Structure in main
```
app/
├── main/               # The main module - comes preconfigured with the app
│   ├── controllers/    # Controllers (C)
│   ├── models/         # Models (M)
│   └── views/          # Views (V)
```

## Quick Start with main

You can start directly by using the MVC pattern with the `main` module:
1. Models: Place your models in `main/models`
2. Controllers: Add your controllers in `main/controllers`
3. Views: Format the data in the controllers

## Conclusion

The MVC pattern in Kawkab helps to:
- Organize code logically
- Separate responsibilities between components
- Make maintenance and development easier

With the default `main` module, you can start developing your app immediately without additional setup.
