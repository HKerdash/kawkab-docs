# HMVC Pattern in Kawkab

The HMVC (Hierarchical Model-View-Controller) pattern is an extension of the traditional MVC pattern, where the application is organized into independent modules. In Kawkab, each module has its own MVC.

## What is HMVC?

### What is HMVC?
- **H** stands for Hierarchical
- **MVC** refers to the same basic components (Model, View, Controller)
- Each module operates independently
- Modules can communicate with each other

## Module Structure

```
app/
├── modules/
│   ├── main/           # Main module
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   └── views/
│   │
│   ├── blog/          # Blog module
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   └── views/
│   │
│   └── shop/          # Shop module
│       ├── controllers/
│       ├── models/
│       └── views/
```

## Creating a New Module

You can create a new module using the following command:

```bash
npm run kawkab module:make blog
```

## Module Examples

### 1. Blog Module
```typescript
// app/modules/blog/controllers/posts/index.ts
export default class extends BaseController {
    get() {
        return {
            message: "Blog Posts",
            data: [
                { title: "First Post" },
                { title: "Second Post" }
            ]
        };
    }
}
```

### 2. Shop Module
```typescript
// app/modules/shop/controllers/products/index.ts
export default class extends BaseController {
    get() {
        return {
            message: "Shop Products",
            data: [
                { name: "Product 1" },
                { name: "Product 2" }
            ]
        };
    }
}
```

## Benefits of HMVC in Kawkab

### 1. Better Code Organization
- Each module is independent
- Easier management of large projects
- Logical division of functionality

### 2. Code Reusability
- A module can be reused in different projects
- Shared functionality between modules
- Reduces code duplication

### 3. Easier Maintenance
- Modifying one module doesn't affect others
- Testing each module independently
- Easy updates to functionality

## Best Practices

1. **Logical Division of Modules**
   - Each module represents a distinct part of the application
   - Avoid overlapping between modules

2. **Independence**
   - Each module operates independently
   - Minimize dependencies between modules

3. **Reusability**
   - Design modules to be reusable
   - Share common components between modules

## Conclusion

The HMVC pattern in Kawkab provides:
- Better organization for large projects
- Flexibility in managing modules
- Scalability and maintainability
- Code reusability

You can start with the main module and then add new modules as needed for your project.
