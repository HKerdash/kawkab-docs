# **The Architecture of Kawkab**

The **Kawkab** framework relies on the **HMVC** (Hierarchical Model-View-Controller) architecture to enhance project organization and scalability.

## **Overview**

The HMVC architecture divides the project into distinct hierarchical modules, improving task separation and allowing for more flexible application organization. This architecture enables the building of complex applications in an organized and scalable manner.

## **Key Features**

- **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into separate modules, each handling a specific function within the application.
- **Main Module**: Kawkab includes a main module by default, serving as the core of the system.
- **Scalability**: The modular design supports easy expansion and maintenance of the application.

## **Benefits**

- **Improved Organization**: Dividing the project into clear modules enhances project organization and management.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Adding or updating features becomes more straightforward and smooth, promoting the project's long-term growth.
- **Task Separation**: Each module focuses on specific aspects of the application, reducing complexity and increasing maintainability.

By adopting the HMVC architecture, Kawkab provides a robust framework for building scalable and well-organized applications, facilitating the development of large and complex projects.
